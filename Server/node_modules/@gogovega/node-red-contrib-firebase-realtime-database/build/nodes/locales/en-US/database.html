	<p>This node is used to authenticate with Firebase.</p>
	<p>The authentication methods are as follows:</p>
	<ul>
		<li>Anonymous</li>
		<li>Email and Password</li>
		<li>Private Key (Admin SDK)</li>
		<li>Custom Token Generated with Private Key</li>
	</ul>
	<p><strong>API Key</strong>: can be found in the project settings.</p>
	<p><strong>URL</strong>: can be found in the Realtime Database console.</p>
	<p>
		<strong>Email and Password</strong>: you must create a user either in the <strong>Authentication</strong> section
		in the console or the node does it for you.
	</p>
	<p>
		<strong>JSON Private Key</strong>: can be generated in the project settings, in the
		<strong>Service Accounts</strong> tab and then on <strong>Generate new private key</strong>.
		You can manually fill in the <strong>Email Client</strong> and <strong>Private Key</strong> fields or
		let it complete automatically by dragging the JSON file into the gray area.
	</p>
	<p><strong>UID</strong>: uniquely identifies the user or device you are authenticating.</p>
	<p>
		<strong>Claims</strong>: additional claims to include in the custom token, which will be available
		in the <code>auth</code> / <code>request.auth</code> objects of your security rules.
	</p>
